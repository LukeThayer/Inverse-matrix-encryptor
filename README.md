# Inverse-matrix-encryptor WIP
encrypts/decrypts text files using a key


## Encryption Type
 Text files are encrypted by translating the data to numbers then generating a "Key" the Key consists of dimensions of the matrix and then the inverse 
 of the matrix. The text is then placed into a matrix of proper size to multiply against the key and encrypt it, to decrypt the data the encrypted data simply
 needs to places in the correct size matrix then multiplied by the inverse key matrix.
 
## Matrix Math
 For this project I wrote my own simple matrix data type with all the needed math operators for matricies along with row manipualtions.
  -  row swapping
  -  multiplication (scalar and vector)
  -  addition
